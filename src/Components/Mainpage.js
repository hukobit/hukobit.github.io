                  What?! She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?

                          Don't underestimate the Force. As you wish. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I can't get involved!.

Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</li>

                Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.
Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.
I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.

                Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. You mean it controls your actions? Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.                </p>

                Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. What!? Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.                </p>
